Yes, here comes another one. My other five 10/10 albums. Let's start.

### 5. IGOR ( Tyler The Creator )

In this album, Tyler the Creator completely removed the hip-hop style from his previous projects and went to do his own thing. And it completely sounds amazing from start to finish. And to be honest, I never thought Ad-libs from Playboi Carti could carry this album, like in the song “Earfquake”. The best things in this album are just beats, synthwave, and samples. I don’t have many things to say about this album. Just go and listen to it.

Favorite Song: Gone Gone/Thank You ( Thank You )

### 4. In Rainbows ( Radiohead )

This may or may not be Radiohead’s best album, but it is definitely my favorite album. From the start to the end of the album, there wasn’t a single skip. Radiohead sometimes embraces a really experimental style of guitar and chord progression, and you will see those styles in albums like OK Computer and Kid A. And this album is no exception. What I love about this album is the mix of lo-fi, indie, and punk, but It doesn’t feel like this album fits into those categories.

Favorite Song: Nude

### 3. College Dropout ( Kanye West )

This album is why people love Kanye West, even if he did many cancellable shits and did controversial things. First of all, this album, in terms of both context, lyrics, and production, is his best album. There are many controversial lyrics in this album, as he is Kanye West, but unlike Yeezus or TLOP, this album's controversial contexts are inspirational, and it doesn’t feel like he is forcing his opinions. Like in the song “The New Workout Plan,” the beats and lyrics are just so funny and vibey that you don’t even notice he is critiquing how women are adjusting their lifestyles to pull basketball players, rappers, or famous people. Also, “All Falls Down” is Kanye’s Top 3 Song.

Favorite Song: All Falls Down

### 2. Mm...Food ( MF Doom )

Yes, I know Madvillainy is better, but this one is my personal favorite. This album can be felt as a step down from Madvillainy in terms of production, but his metaphors, writing, and sampling on this album are still insane. Like the song in “One Beer”, I really love how he compares himself to being the only rapper left in the game and coming to steal the show. And of course, as MF Doom, his punchlines are really good. And you can see his references in the song, like “Hoes Cake”. You don’t listen to MF Doom; you study him, and this album is the definition of that.

Favorite Song: Hoes Cake

### 1. Demon Days ( Gorillaz )

This album is an artistic shift in Gorillaz’s music. And this album, compared to their previous self-titled one, felt like a completely new one. In some songs, they went experimental; in some songs, they went hard with the beat. I really love the background sounds from the kids in “Dirty Harry”, and I really admire how they went experimental with that style. And god, MF Doom went absolutely insane with his verse in “November Has Come”. And songs like “Dare” are just absolute vibes. And I forgot to mention that the rapping on this album is just incredible, and I love how they fit the hip-hop style into their alternative style.

Favorite Song: Dirty Harry
