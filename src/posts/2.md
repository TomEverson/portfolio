Hello there! Well, I am not a music nerd, and I don't often rate albums. Music is quite subjective, after all. But occasionally, there are some albums that I really enjoy and would like to listen to on repeat. So yeah, I called them 10/10. They may not really be a 10/10 album if you do a deep analysis, but, according to my taste, they are. If you don't enjoy it, then it is fine. Ok, then, let's start.

### 5. Nurture (Porter Robinson)

I don't listen to EDM very often. But this one is an exception. This album is a mix of dreamcore, Japanese lo-fi, folk, and ambient music, and it is quite unique. When you listen to most EDM albums, like Chainsmokers', the lyrics are just straight up cringey or unrelatable. And in terms of writing EDM songs, I think Porter improved his writing skills a lot on this album compared to his previous projects. In songs like "Get Your Wish", you will see how much he buffed up the lyrics. There were sometimes repeating synth notes throughout the song that gave it a weird dreamcore aesthetic and slowly converge into lofi aesthetic. You will hear that in "Dullscythe" and "Mirror". You will see the major influence of Japanese lofi and folk in songs like "Lifelike", or "Wind Tempos". The beat switches on this album are just really incredible. Simply put, this is like an album that you want to dance along to but, at the same time, makes you really sad and want to cry. Overall, I really love this album, and you should give it a try.

Favorite Song: Get your wish

### 4. Plastic Beach (Gorillaz)

This album right here—I can call it a masterpiece. This album started off with orchestral rap songs and descended slowly into alternative rock/rap songs, alternative indie, and back to synthwave. Every song here is very unique, and each song has its own characteristics. One thing I like about this album is that the beats are just really catchy, and they are quite experimental in some songs. Like in "Glitter Freeze",  it is just 4 minutes of pure Star Wars battle. And there were songs like "On Melachony Hill" and "Stylo" where the beats are too funky but the lyrics are just straight-up depressing. And the album holds this aesthetic very well. It is like a mix of feelings and emotions. I think "Empire Ants" might be their best song in terms of creativity here. It starts slowly, and when the verse changes, it just makes me tear up. Also, check out their music video. This album is like the Avengers Endgame for Gorillaz.

Favorite Song: Empire Ants

### 3. Kids See Ghost (Kids See Ghost-Ye & Kid Cudi)

This album right here is hella weird, both in terms of production and beats. When you listen to this album, you feel like you are lost in Murakami's dimension (Murakami is a famous Japanese artist and drew Kid See Ghost's album cover). How weird is this album? Well, if you look at the song "Feel the Love", you will hear Ye's "Grrhhhhh, Grhhhh" sounds, which are both terrifying and perplexing mixed with heavy drums, and "I can still feel the love," by Kid Cudi, which makes you feel like you are being followed by a mysterious ghost. And, in songs like "4th Dimension,", you will see chores singing, and on some occasions, you will hear weird laughing noises, and Ye's lyrics are quite funny and wtf. (Of course, it is Ye.)And this weird aesthetic is carried throughout the album, but you will see there is some influence of post-rap in songs like "Fire", or "Free". Also, Reborn is a really good lullaby. To summarize this album, it is just weirdly mystifying.

Favorite Song: 4th Dimension

### 2. I Didn't Meant To Haunt You (Quadeca)

You won't believe that this album was produced by a YouTube rapper. It is really impressive. First of all, the album's narrative was really well written. It is like he has died and is now wandering around like a ghost. The instruments in the opening track are just bangers. And I really enjoy the style of rapping in almost every song. It is jarring and, at the same time, gives the feeling of emo-rap. And with the blast of noisy music, it is quite depressing, but at the same time, it can't make you bored. The best examples of rapping here are in "House Settling" and "Knots". I don't blame him for his vocals since he is a rap artist, but I think they could be better; yet still, his vocals in songs like "Fantasyworld" are really mesmerizing. I think the best-produced song here is "Fractions of Infinity". It is the song God played in heaven when you died, and I am not joking.

Favorite Song: Fractions of Infinity

### 1. Crumbling (Mid-Air Thief)

Let me say something controversial. I have never heard an album this amazing produced by Korean artists. And I discovered this artist after listening to Sonny Boy's OST, thinking he/she was a Japanese artist. So, I got into Crumbling. I can say that this is the best folktronica album that I have ever heard. The verses and beat switches are really amazing, and the vocals from Summer Soul really elevate this album. Even though I don't understand a single Korean, I really cried during the second part of "Curve and Light". I don't have anything to say because this album is really breathtaking. Just go listen to it and decide.
